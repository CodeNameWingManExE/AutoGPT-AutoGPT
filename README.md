AutoGPT is a Xcode Source Editor extension that enhances productivity by leveraging the capabilities of GPT. It helps you to automate common coding tasks and streamline your workflow. AutoGPT uses the OpenAI's API and gives you the option to choose between four powefull models Davinci, Curie, Babbage and Ada.

Model  | Description 
------------- | -------------
Davinci  | Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following.
Curie  | Very capable, but faster and lower cost than Davinci.
Babbage  | Capable of straightforward tasks, very fast, and lower cost.
Ada  | Capable of very simple tasks, usually the fastest model in the GPT-3 series, and lowest cost.
